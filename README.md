Professional AI Chatbot
This project is a professional-grade AI chatbot built using Python, PyTorch, and the Flask web framework. The chatbot features advanced machine learning capabilities, real-time learning from user feedback, a session-based memory system, and integrated mathematical calculation abilities. It aims to provide an intelligent, interactive assistant suitable for deployment in academic or enterprise environments.

Features
Intelligent Response Generation: Uses a deep neural network trained on extensive intents data.

Real-Time Learning: Updates chatbot knowledge based on user feedback on the fly.

Session Memory: Remembers corrections and improvements during a user session.

Mathematical Calculations: Handles complex math queries including arithmetic, percentages, powers, and roots.

Contextual Understanding: Maintains conversation context for multi-turn dialogues.

User-Friendly Web Interface: Clean, modern UI with responsive design and accessibility support.

Feedback System: Allows users to provide feedback and correct chatbot answers interactively.

Analytics Dashboard: Displays learning progress and session statistics.

Export Chat History: Enables downloading transcript of chat conversations.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare intents and training data:

Make sure the intents_augmented.json file is present and contains your chatbot intents.

Run the application:

bash
python app.py
Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Usage
Type your queries in the chat interface.

The bot responds based on trained intents or mathematical queries.

If the response is not satisfactory, provide feedback via the interactive buttons.

You can teach the bot new responses directly from the interface; it learns and improves over time.

Use the 'Stats' button to view your session statistics and learning data.

Use the 'Clear' button to reset your session memory.

Export your chat transcript anytime via the 'Export' button.
